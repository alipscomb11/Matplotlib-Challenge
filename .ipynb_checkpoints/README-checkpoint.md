# Matplotlib-Challenge

Challenge Observations:

Observation 1:
When assessing the Tumor Volume based on the various drug regimens, the drug Ketapril yields the largest Mean Tumor Volume, as well as the largest Variance, Standard Deviation, and SEM Volume.

Observation 2:
Capomulin and Ramicane had the highest number of rows for each drug regimen. 

Observation 3:
There were slightly more female mice (51%) used in this experiment as opposed to male mice (49%). 

Observation 4:
For a single mouse, the tumor volume decreased over time with the use of Capomulin 

Observation 5:
There is a direct correlation between Average Tumor Volume and Mouse Weight. Mouse Weight increases as Tumor Volume increases, with a resulting Correlation Coefficient of 0.8419.
